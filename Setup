Equipment: 
- 2 Cluster Racks (Holds 4 Each)
- 8 Raspberry Pi 4's (4 GB each)
- 8 Raspberry PoE hats
- 1 8 PoE port switch
- 9 cat6 ethernet cables
- 8 micro sd cards
- 1 mini-hdmi to hdmi cord
- Raspberry Pi Keyboard

Assembly:






Download the latest ubuntu server for raspberry pi. (As of current, using 20.04 LTS)
https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi

Burn the image on microsd card using etcher. 
https://www.balena.io/etcher/

Plug the microsd card to Raspberry pi instance. (Configure one at a time.)

Login with default ubuntu credentials. Username and password is Ubuntu

Login as Root.
sudo su -

Internet Connectivity and Setting up Static IP address.
By default, ubuntu server will not intiate a dhcp request for an ip address. This has to be manually done.

dhclient -v

Install updates and upgrade os packages.
apt update && apt upgrade -y

Install net-tools (To use ifconfig)
apt install net-tools

Ok lets setup a static ip address:
Starting with Ubuntu 18.04, the new way to configure networking is through netplan.
Netplan abstracts network configuration through yaml, which is placed in /etc/netplan.  
For my info on netplan https://netplan.io/

To create static ip config:  (Used instructions from this site: https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-configure-a-static-ip-address-in-ubuntu-server-18-04/)

vim /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

Example of my network config in one of my nodes:
network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
      eth0:
        dhcp4: no
        addresses: [192.168.1.211/24]
        gateway: 192.168.1.254
        nameservers:
          addresses: [127.0.0.53]
          
Save the config file, then to apply the changes: 
netplan apply

The server should now use that static ip address upon startup!

To make it easier on me to differentiate amongst servers, Im going to change the hostnames.

I also plan to implement a local dns server, so each server can easily find and connect to each other.
